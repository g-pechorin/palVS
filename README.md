# Visual Studio Plugin

I got mad that I couldn't work with V$ in the same way as [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
So I've made [a V$ plugin](https://github.com/g-pechorin/palVS/raw/master/dist/palVSNPpp.vsix) to open my current file in [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

It was made with / used by [Visual Studio Community 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).
If you want to this project it you'll need the [Visual Studio SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40758).
I'd also advocate that you use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) with their [plugin for Visual Studio](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-visualstudio#readme)
